Data Management: PR Talk vs. Reality

Ever noticed how sometimes companies boast about their data-driven strategies in public relations, but behind the scenes, their data management practices tell a different story?

In PR: "Thanks to our successful digital transformation, we are a data-driven company leveraging AI to innovate and grow."

In Reality: "We don't need data quality management, our data is already good. And why do we need to document our data?"

I believe the issue stems from a lack of clarity. Being data-driven or achieving digital transformation is not an end in itself; it's merely a means (for all my marketing folks out there: it's a feature, not a benefit).

For me, the real questions should be:

 1. What does your company want to accomplish?

 2. How can data help move towards those goals?

From there start small and iterate

But if you chase buzzwords, that's what you'll get in the end... buzzwords.
