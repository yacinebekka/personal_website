Let me explain the process I use with my clients to manage their data quality 👇

📜 Define initial standards for monitoring hashtag#dataquality

- Document business rules and derive associated data quality indicators
- Define monitoring methodology (frequency, queries used, etc.)

👀 Start monitoring

- Conduct initial data quality monitoring based on the newly defined standards
- Identify current data quality issues (non-compliance with one or more business rules)

🧠 Investigate root causes and effort for data correction

- Analyze the data quality issues to understand what the root cause(s) are and what effort is required to correct the data affected by them

🗣️ Communicate findings with the business and establish priorities

- Share your findings with business stakeholders and determine the criticality of the issue based on business impact
- Determine priority based on cost (effort required to correct the data and root cause) and benefit (business impact)

🔧 Correct data and root cause(s)

- Ideally, data correction should be done in the source system
- Depending on the context (legacy application that cannot be updated, etc.), sometimes the correction needs to be done on the fly between the source and the data warehouse

🔄 Iterate

- Ensure that data consumers have the opportunity to raise issues not covered by the process
- The quality standard should be updated after new business/quality rules are created or discovered
