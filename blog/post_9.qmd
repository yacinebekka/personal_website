Have you already heard about "data reliability" ?

I didn’t know about it either until I stumbled across it recently in my Linkedin feed so i looked into it :

 - Do you trust your hashtag#data ?

 - If you ask them something will they tell the truth ?

 - Will they be there when you need them the most ?

All of those aspects can be summarized by are your data reliable… 👏 

"I got it but isn’t it the same than hashtag#dataquality ?" 🧐

Almost, but with a small tweak. 

Just take data quality over a period of time and voilà… you have data reliability 📈 

Also, the term is quite popular in the data engineering community but less so with the data management folks that will usually prefer data quality.

Data reliability is as important as data quality as it impacts all processes and tools that use data.

With reliable data you will increase the knowledge you have on your company and your market which will lead to better business decisions.

With unreliable data though, you will face issues with every hashtag#digital related initiatives.

It will prevents your company from having efficient operations and benefiting from the latest innovations in analytics and machine learning.
