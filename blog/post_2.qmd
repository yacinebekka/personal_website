I do not recommend to set goals in terms of hashtag#dataquality levels, unless you are already advanced in your data quality management process. 

The main 3 reasons why i don't recommend setting goals are â¬‡ 

- â›” Not enough business clarity on your data quality indicators. You probably don't have enough understanding yet on the hashtag#businessrules that govern your data objects, so your data quality indicators might not be that significant in terms of quality (accurate representation and fit-for-purpose in terms of business processes)

- â›” No full picture on all your current data quality issues and their business impact (due to the point above), so no precise idea of their relative priority.

- â›” No complete understanding of the root causes of those issues. If this the case, the effort required to resolve the issues remains unknown, neither if it's actually possible or a good trade in terms of cost/benefits.

If all those aspects are covered within systematic, iterative and "evidence-based" data quality management process then only i would start setting goals in terms of what level of data quality for a given dataset/data object i want to achieve over a period.

In my opinion, a better way to measure progress in the beginning of your data quality journey would be the coverage of the data quality management in terms of business scope and/or percentage of data quality issues resolved over a period.

In a way it's like dieting, when you start you do not have direct control over the final outcomes (how much weight you lose/gain) but you have control over the process (sticking to it over time) and that is where the improvement comes. After a while, once you know your body well and how you react to diet, then you can set more realistic goals in terms of weight gain/loss over the next months.
