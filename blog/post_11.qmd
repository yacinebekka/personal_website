Do you struggle to explain the value of data to your boss and co-workers? ðŸ¤”

As data professionals, we can get caught up in our own expertise and forget about the perspective of "non-data" folks.

To help bridge the gap, I've created a visual to show how data can tie into business outcomes.

There are three significant ways that data can impact a company (assuming you're not a tech company):

- Better decision-making (analytics): The ability to extract trustworthy information on your market and operations for business decisions.

- Automation (AI): Innovation and operational improvement through automation for more value with less effort.

- Avoiding operational disasters (data quality): Bad data quality can cause disasters like NASA's lost Mars Orbiter worth â‚¬125M due to a unit of measure error ! ðŸ˜±

(The NASA disaster will be the topic of an upcoming post, so make sure to follow me if you donâ€™t want to miss it ðŸ˜‰)

All of these require the right peoples, tools, and processes to manage data end-to-end in your company.

Easy peasy, right? ðŸ˜‡
